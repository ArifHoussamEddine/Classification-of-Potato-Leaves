# Potato Leaf Classification using Deep Learning

This project aims to classify potato leaves into two categories: **Healthy** and **Late Blight**. It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, a deep learning technique, to automatically detect plant diseases from images of potato leaves. This early detection can help reduce agricultural losses and assist farmers in improving crop health management.

## 🚀 Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: 
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## 📊 Performance Results:
- **Training Accuracy**: 99%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 98%
- The model shows strong performance, indicating effective learning and generalization to new, unseen data.

## 🔍 Dataset:
- The dataset contains high-resolution images of potato leaves.
- Categories: **Healthy** and **Late Blight**.
- The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](/kaggle/input/potato-leaf-healthy-and-late-blight).
